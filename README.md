# Fraudulent_Transactions



The objective of this project is to develop a robust machine learning model that accurately predicts fraudulent transactions for a financial company. This project involves a comprehensive approach, starting with data cleaning and preprocessing, which includes handling missing values, detecting, and removing outliers, and encoding categorical variables. Following the data preparation, various machine learning models are trained and fine-tuned to achieve the best performance. The model's insights will be used to develop actionable strategies to mitigate and prevent fraudulent activities, thereby enhancing the financial security of the company. The ultimate goal is to provide a reliable solution that can be integrated into the company's transaction processing system to detect and prevent fraudulent transactions in real-time.
